# Media Matchup
A fun and odd  comparison app where various forms of media battle for your vote. Comparisons are "apples to oranges," pitting different categories of media against one another such as film, musical albums, video games, artwork, and television. 

## The Game
Two forms of media are generated after being filtered by general popularity and current pop-culture relevance. These are compared side by side, allowing the user to decide which they think is better. This decision is then logged to their profile, where friends can view ( and in the future interact ) with these choices.

### Daily Ten
There are ten matchups generated daily that are shared among all users, allowing us to gather interesting data about matchups and offering users a chance to see how their decision compares to everyone else on the platform. 

### Planned Features
The game element is generally complete, but will be optimized for speed and bug removal as time progresses. There are plans to translate this system to React Native as a mobile app, but this will come after the overall game has been mostly smoothed over.

## Social
A major component of Media Matchup is social interaction, from viewing your friends' matchup history and complaining about their choices to seeing how your vote stacks up against the overall community. We have plans to add more features, but these are the core components that fuel Media Matchup today.

### Planned (Important) Social Features
- Comments on every matchup
- Seperate comment section for "local" matchups in friends' feeds
- Matchups shareable on other platforms 
- More robust feed 
- Community tab with fun information about daily 10 matchups
