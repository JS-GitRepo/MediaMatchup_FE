# Media Matchup
A fun and odd  comparison app where various forms of media battle for your vote. Comparisons are quite "apples to oranges," pitting different categories of media against one another such as film, musical albums, video games, artwork, and television. 

## Social
A major component of Media Matchup is social interaction, from viewing your friends' matchup history and complaining about their choices to seeing how your vote stacks up against the overall community. We have plans to add more features, but these are the core components that fuel Media Matchup today.

### Planned (Important) Social Features
- Comments on every matchup
- Seperate comment section for "local" matchups in friends' feeds
- Matchups shareable on other platforms 
- More robust feed 
- Community tab with fun information about daily 10 matchups
